# Rayc

Rayc is a virtual pet you can own and raise within the game. You can feed it, train it to make it stronger, send it to expeditions, evolve it, observe its daily activities for fun or trade as NFTs.

## Inspiration
Although there are other alternative pet games in the market, pets usually do **routine** stuff and it gets **boring** after a while since the game becomes predictable. Pets also do not have a clear identify and usually fail to establish bonds with the player. 

With that in mind, we want to create a **chill, casual and fun** pet game where the pets are constantly **interacting with the surrounding** and **surprising the players with their fun daily activities**.

With the blockchain technology, we want to enable players to actually make transactions on the pets they own to gain a greater sense of achievement. 

All of these lead to the creation of our game Rayc.
